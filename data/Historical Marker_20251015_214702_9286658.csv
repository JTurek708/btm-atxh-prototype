Relative prosperity followed for a generation as this alluvial valley produced crops of maize, beans, melons, calabashes, sweet potatoes, and cotton, but deterioration had set in at Espada before the secularization of the mission in 1794, when only fifteen sick or aged Indians remained in the mission. Even so, dam, ditch, and aqueduct survived nearly a century of Indian attacks, ravaging floods, and controversy, both secular and clerical.

Operated by the local office of the Freedmen's Bureau, the school was a two-story stone structure.

The family purchased 101 acres in 1875 and a smaller tract including this site in 1876. They built a small log cabin and stone kitchen that year with the help of neighbors, including family friend and stonemason Henry Nentwich, whose daughter Elizabeth later married the Krauses' son Charles. The logs were hewn from local elm trees and the sandstone was found nearby. Additions were made as the family grew over the years. From January 1879 to November 1880 and again from September to December 1886, Anton Krause served as postmaster of Mann's Crossing, using his house as the post office.

The student head of the Glee Club, Lewis Johnson, urged Sinclair to write a school song in 1903. His first attempt was ""The Jolly Students of Varsity."" His second, to the tune of ""I've Been Working on The Railroad,"" was ""The Eyes of Texas Are Upon You."" UT President William L. Prather, formerly a student at Washington College (later Washington and Lee University), had often heard Robert E. Lee admonish his students, ""The Eyes of The South Are Upon You."" Prather altered the saying for use at UT, and Sinclair borrowed it for his song. ""The Eyes of Texas,"" first performed at a minstrel show at Austin's Hancock Opera House to benefit the UT track team, was an instant success. Sinclair graduated in 1904 and returned to his family's dairy farm in eastern Bexar County. When Prather died in 1905, his family requested a performance of ""The Eyes of Texas"" at his funeral. Sinclair moved to New York City, where he and his wife, Stella Anderson of San Antonio (also a UT graduate) were active in the New York Texas Exes' Association. The song was so popular throughout the nation that many confused it with the official state song of Texas. After years of copyright battles, the UT acquired the rights to it in the 1980s.

Later additions accommodated the growing family, which included thirteen children, eight of whom survived into adulthood. According to family history, a daughter, Mathilda, was abducted from the home as a toddler by raiding Indians. A group from the nearby Powderhouse Hill neighborhood formed a posse and brought her back. Located along Texas' western frontier, San Antonio was prey to such attacks throughout much of the early 1800s. Anna Barbara worked as a midwife. Johann (or John), a stonemason, worked on the church, rectory, and St. Joseph's Society's Hall of St. Joseph's Catholic Church, a German parish established in 1871. He probably built his homes on this site, beginning work on this larger house between 1882 and 1884.

In addition, he edited the Helotes Echo newspaper, and his articles were said to be instrumental in the creation of the Northside Independent School District for Helotes-area students. His business establishment served as a gathering place for several organizations and events, including the annual Helotes Cornyval Festival. Since Floore's death in 1975, his legacy has continued.

Sir Edmund Halley (1656-1742) later predicted that using data from such crossings, known as transits, scientists could precisely quantify the astronomical unit of distance and measure the size of the solar system. The transits of Venus predicatably come in pairs, eight years apart, approximately every 120 years. Scientists from around the world traveled to observation sites during the next events, in 1761 and 1769, but timing of the transits was difficult due to the ""black drop effect,"" in which two objects against a bright background appear to blend. For more than a century, astronomers prepared for the next opportunity to record Venus' transit. Jean-Charles Houzeau (1820-1888) was a Belgian astronomer with an eclectic history. From 1859 to 1861, he worked as a surveyor in Uvalde, Texas. An abolitionist, he left Texas at the start of the Civil War. In the late 1870s, he returned to Belgium, where he became director of the Royal Observatory and planned the Belgian teams that would go to the western hemisphere to observe the December 1882 transit of Venus. He chose one site in Chile and one (22 feet east) in San Antonio. Good observations required clear skies, and San Antonio offered the chance of favorable weather, as well as good logistics for communication and transportation. A U.S. Naval Observatory team observed from a site on the grounds of nearby Fort Sam Houston. Using a heliometer, a device he had developed for the observation, Houzeau obtained 124 photographic plates of Venus silhouetted against the sun. Because of clearer conditions, the team in Chile obtained 606. The Belgian findings equaled those of larger nations, and Houzeau's decision to bring an international team to San Antonio provided the city recognition as part of astronomical history.

As a child, Tenayuca had often visited the Plaza Del Zacate (now Milam Park), where residents gathered to discuss politics and civil issues in the days before Spanish radio programming. These visits awakened in her awareness of injustice, and she converted her concern into action. Tenayuca joined the Workers Alliance of America and other activist political organizations because of their philosophy in favor of workers' rights. As a gifted and compassionate orator, she organized and participated in many demonstrations in support of San Antonio workers. In 1938, Tenayuca led thousands of pecan shellers, most of whom were Hispanic women, to walk off the job in protest of proposed pay cuts. San Antonio served as the center of the U.S. shelling industry, and typical salaries ranged from only two to three dollars per week. The strike was one of the first successful actions in the Mexican-American struggle for political and social justice. Unable to find work in Texas in part because of her political activities, Tenayuca relocated to California in 1945, where she earned an undergraduate degree.

In danger of retribution, 2,500 Mexican civilians, including 527 Chinese, accompanied Pershing when he returned to the U.S. in February 1917. Because of the Chinese Exclusion Act (1882), which banned Chinese immigration into the United States, Pershing had to request special permission to bring the Chinese across the border.

In June 1917, most of the group was moved to San Antonio, where they served as laborers, carpenters and cooks at Camp Wilson (Camp Travis), Fort Sam Houston and Kelly Field in preparation for World War I. They worked admirably and at night attended an English school established by William Page, civilian advisor for the immigrants. To prevent deportation of the refugees after World War I, Page and General Pershing, with the help of a law firm, developed a plan to ask Congress to take action in giving the immigrants permanent resident status.

Larkin Carper began conducting services in the homes of San Antonio's Black families. Paine Chapel soon deeded him a building and the Colored Methodist Episcopal Church was founded. With the Freedmen's Bureau, members established the Lincoln School for African-American students in 1866. Members built a frame building in 1872 on land donated by church member McDaniel Webster; a stone structure replaced it in 1884. The area surrounding church property became known as St. Paul Square. The current sanctuary was completed in 1922.
  St. Paul first focused on community work through a Benevolent Society. The congregation also played a major role in the civil rights movement in San Antonio. The Rev. Mack Henson became a well-known voice for equality in the late 1800s. Dr. Green J. Starnes and other members continued the work in the early 20th century, focusing on education, health and social justice.

Bartholomew learned about cement production at the Alamo Portland and Roman Cement Company, which was the first cement manufacturer west of the Mississippi. Built in 1914, Belknap place was at the forefront of the new pavement technology.

Houston streets",False,In Situ,"27"" x 42"""," San Antonio’s black population can be traced back to the city’s earliest days. Presidial soldiers included many of African and American Indian ancestry. Later, Canary Islanders would bring their North African Berber culture with them. In 1876, out of a population of 17,214, some 2,075 citizens were recorded as “African.” Black communities settled in small enclaves throughout the city, including a sizable number west of the San Antonio River.
  By 1885, the city’s Second Ward, which included that portion west of the San Antonio River and north of Commerce Street, was largely populated by black citizens. Primarily residential, the area was anchored by significant community institutions. St. James African Methodist Episcopal Church began in 1868 in a soap factory along San Pedro Creek, and has played a prominent role in the spiritual, social and civic lives of the neighborhood’s residents. The early members were emancipated African Americans. The church moved to its present location on Richter Street in 1928. The exciting West End Baptist Church, founded in 1905, also served the growing black population. Ella Austin (1856-1902), a prominent community leader, first opened an orphans’ home near this site, at 926 West Houston Street, in 1890 before moving to a larger facility on the city’s eastside. Black children attended the Bishop Grant School on N. Leona. Krisch Hall, a German-owned business located at Houston and Flores, hosted black organizations such as the Lonestar Literary Society, the Glee Club and community gatherings.
  Over time, San Antonio’s westside transitioned to a Latino cultural center, African American families and institutions became concentrated on the eastside, and many historic residences were replaced by commercial buildings. Still, the near westside is home to many African Americans and remains an important example of the city’s layers of history and cultural diversity.   (2016)",False,False,True

A Silesian Missionary, Reverend Leopold Moczygemba, ministering to Prussian immigrants at Castroville and New Braunfels, wrote letters home praising life on the Texas frontier. From 1854 to 1857, several Silesian immigrant groups traveled to Texas and, specifically, to San Antonio. Some of these immigrants remained in San Antonio while others continued on their journey to Panna Maria, Bandera and St. Hedwig, where they established the first Polish communities in the United States. From their first arrival in 1854, Polish immigrants transcribed into San Antonio’s narrative, the registration of cattle brands, voting, participation in the census, and the construction of homes, businesses, a church and school. Following the Civil War, St. Michael’s Parish evolved as a church and school which rapidly became the social center of the Polish Quarter. Most residents sought employment in the community trades and contributed to a growing labor source in San Antonio’s economy, particularly in the iron industry at George Holmgreen’s foundry that later emerged as Alamo Iron Works. In addition to their impact upon the landscape and culture of San Antonio, the Polish Quarter provided an urban link to the surrounding rural Polish communities, mainly through St. Michael’s parish but also as a connection to their ancestral roots.

The neighborhood at the time consisted of one- and two-story residences and a few undeveloped lots. Mary Drake built a two-story house with queen anne-style architectural features, completed in 1895. The home’s architect is unknown but historic photographs show an asymmetrical façade with a cross-gabled roof and prominent turret, spindled balustrades along the front porch and patterned masonry chimneys. The Drake family sold the property in 1901 to William Alexander and Louisa Fitch, who only lived here a short time. Bastrop native Van Alvin Petty, Sr. (1860-1929) and his wife, Mary Cordelia (Dabney) Petty (1861-1943), purchased this house in November 1901. As president of Olive-Sternenberg Lumber Company, Petty operated a thriving business while also investing in San Antonio’s real estate market since the 1890s. In 1910 and 1911, Petty undertook a major renovation of the house, designed by noted architect Atlee B. Ayres and under the management of general contractor Otto Lindau. Neoclassical architectural style was applied to the home, bringing symmetry to all sides and adding a new gallery on the second floor, an extension to the rear, and two-story corinthian columns.

Prior to the Civil War, the 20-acre San Antonio Arsenal, established in 1859, was the largest federal military presence in the region. It was the San Antonio Arsenal that supplied the forts to the west and would continue to sustain the 9th Cavalry in its Texas deployments to Ft. Davis, Ft. Quitman, Ft. Stockton and elsewhere. The San Pedro Springs encampment was established two miles north of the San Antonio Arsenal site in a lush landscape. By April 14, 1867, the entire regiment arrived, assembled and organized by company into a tented camp covering several acres and encroaching on the settlers nearby. Described by the newspaper as a “canvas city,” Buffalo Soldiers were reported as “superior to white soldiers in discipline, fidelity, neatness, sobriety, and equal in bravery.” The 1867 San Pedro Springs encampment of the 9th Cavalry provided a site for training and preparation of a key component of the military. The men served valiantly on the western frontier and were awarded numerous medals of honor and other commendations. As the military desegregated, the 9th Cavalry continued to evolve into modern armored and airborne operations, which trace their heritage to the post-civil war training near here, part of the African American role in San Antonio’s cultural history.

After the Civil War, Polish missionary priests from the society of the resurrection came to Texas to minister to the immigrants. St. Michael’s Parish was created in November 1866 to serve San Antonio’s growing Polish population. Its church and school would become the religious and social center for the community, known as the Polish Quarter. Located on South Street, between Matagorda and Indianola streets (near the existing Hemisfair Tower), St. Michael’s Parish grew from 36 families in 1866 to 900 families by 1949. Father Vincent Barzynski was the first resident pastor. In 1873, a school was opened by the Sisters of the Immaculate Conception of Panna Maria, who conducted classes until 1880. Subsequently, the Ursuline Sisters built a school on the church grounds. This building was eventually given to the parish and then managed by the Sisters of the Divine Providence. In 1922, the old church was demolished, and a larger, more ornate building of white brick was erected. St. Michael’s Parish continued to be a place where the Polish culture and language thrived. The church was a safe haven and a social network, a place to display their unique culture, and a cohesive element for the polish quarter.

She began a church, called “The East End Mission,” in her home at the corner of Hedges and South Gevers Streets. When the number of attendees rose so that Napier’s house could not contain them, she petitioned the Methodist elders to open a church. Under the leadership of the Reverend J.T. Jacobs, the first church was built. Following the Rev. Jacobs’ death in 1911, the name of the church was changed to Jacobs Chapel Methodist Church. 
  In 1925 and 1948, new buildings were constructed. In 1943, Ernest T. Dixon, who was serving as Sunday school superintendent at Jacobs Chapel, received his first preaching license. In July 1972, he became the first African American elected to the Office of Bishop in the south-central jurisdiction of the United Methodist Church. During the tenure of the Reverend E.

The building’s design included battery rooms and a cable vault, locker rooms, an operators’ cafeteria and a grass tennis court on the adjacent grounds. Thirty-five operators were standing by to connect customers on the opening night.
  In 1936, the building was sold to Tobin Aerial Surveys. After training as a combat pilot in World War I, San Antonio native Edgar G. Tobin transferred his skills to creating some of the first aerial photographs for commercial purposes, including oil leases, land maps and property ownership maps.

From their headquarters here, the company coordinated aerial mapping of large portions of the United States during World War II. In 1955, the building was sold to the United Cerebral Palsy Association (UCP). At this time, a hydraulic piston elevator was installed. UCP advocated for those afflicted with cerebral palsy and their families. UCP sold the building in 1963, and it was converted to residential use.

Upon the United States’ entrance into WWII, Wainwright was stationed in France and named the Assistant Chief of Staff of the 82nd infantry division. After the war, he served at multiple bases in the United States. 
  In 1940, Wainwright was stationed at Fort Stotsenburg on the island of Luzon in the Philippines.

The following month, Bataan fell to the Japanese and the remainder of Wainwright’s troops retreated to Corregidor.
